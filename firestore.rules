/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the HR Management System.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for most data,
 * ensuring that users can only access their own information. Top-level
 * collections are used for data that requires broader access or
 * administrative oversight.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles and their related data (attendance, leave requests, payroll, chat messages)
 *   are nested under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Candidates and Anomaly records are stored in top-level collections (`/candidates`, `/anomalies`).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Listing of all users is denied to prevent unauthorized data access.
 * - Path-based ownership is used to simplify and secure access to user-specific data.
 * - The rules are designed to be highly secure, focusing on authorization and relational integrity,
 *   while relaxing validation on data shapes for rapid iteration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The structure enforces Authorization Independence by leveraging path-based ownership for user-specific data, eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 *  - Candidates and anomalies are stored in root-level collections, separate from user-specific data. This segregation enhances query performance and simplifies security rules.
