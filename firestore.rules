/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the HR Management App.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal HR data
 * (attendance, leave requests, payroll, chat messages). Only the authenticated user
 * can access their own data. The `UserProfile` document is also protected by
 * ownership. The `candidates` and `anomalies` collections are open for reads.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: User profile information, where `{userId}` must match the
 *   authenticated user's UID.
 * - `/users/{userId}/attendance/{attendanceId}`: Attendance records for the user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/leaveRequests/{leaveRequestId}`: Leave requests submitted by the user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/payroll/{payrollId}`: Payroll information for the user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/chatMessages/{chatMessageId}`: Chat messages for the user.
 * - `/candidates/{candidateId}`: Job candidate information (top-level collection).
 * - `/anomalies/{anomalyId}`: Anomaly records in attendance (top-level collection).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied at the root level. Listing is only supported
 *   within the user's own subcollections.
 * - Public read access is granted to the `candidates` and `anomalies` collections,
 *   assuming all data in these collections is considered public.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced for all user-specific data through path-based rules.
 *   This avoids the need for complex `get()` calls or document-level checks.
 * - Schema validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase, focusing on authorization.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The data model is designed to avoid `get()` calls. User-specific data is nested
 *   under the `/users/{userId}` path, allowing direct access control based on the
 *   authenticated user's UID.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User-specific data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, while public data
 *   (candidates, anomalies) is stored in top-level collections. This separation
 *   simplifies security rules and improves query performance.
