/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for HR Management System
 *
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated data (attendance, leave requests, payroll, and chat messages).
 *  Candidates and anomalies are stored in top-level collections with open read access and restricted write access.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores public user profile information. The `userId` must match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/attendance/{attendanceId}: Stores attendance records for each employee.
 * - /users/{userId}/leaveRequests/{leaveRequestId}: Stores leave requests submitted by each employee.
 * - /users/{userId}/payroll/{payrollId}: Stores payroll information for each employee.
 * - /users/{userId}/chatMessages/{chatMessagesId}: Stores chat messages for each employee.
 * - /candidates/{candidateId}: Stores job candidates in the recruitment process.
 * - /anomalies/{anomalyId}: Stores detected anomalies in attendance records.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - User listing is disabled to protect user privacy.
 * - User-owned data is strictly limited to the owning user.
 * - Top-level collections (candidates, anomalies) are publicly readable, but writes are restricted.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization
 * - User ownership is enforced through path-based rules, avoiding the need for `get()` calls to determine ownership. The path `/users/{userId}` inherently signifies ownership.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation
 * - Private user data (attendance, leave requests, payroll, chat messages) is stored in user-specific subcollections.
 * - Public/Administrative data (candidates, anomalies) is stored in top-level collections.
