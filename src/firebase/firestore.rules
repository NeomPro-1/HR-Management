/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for the HR and Payroll application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for personal HR data (attendance, leave requests, payroll, chat messages) stored under the `/users/{userId}` path.
 * Users can only access their own profile data and associated subcollections.
 * Candidates and detected anomalies are stored in top-level collections with public read access but restricted write access (TODO: Implement restrictions).
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: User profile information.
 * - `/users/{userId}/attendance/{attendanceId}`: Attendance records for a user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/leaveRequests/{leaveRequestId}`: Leave requests for a user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/payroll/{payrollId}`: Payroll information for a user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/chatMessages/{chatMessageId}`: Chat messages for a user.
 * - `/candidates/{candidateId}`: Job candidate information.
 * - `/anomalies/{anomalyId}`: Detected anomalies in attendance records.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles (`/users/{userId}`) are readable by authenticated users, but only writable by the user themselves.
 * - Subcollections under `/users/{userId}` (attendance, leave requests, payroll, chat messages) are only accessible by the owning user.
 * - Top-level collections for candidates and anomalies are publicly readable (for now, write access is open, but this will be restricted in future iterations).
 * - Listing users is implicitly denied by the absence of a listing rule on the `/users` collection.  This is a security best practice.
 * - Flexible data validation is enabled for rapid prototyping: only fields critical for authorization or relational integrity are validated.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The data model leverages path-based ownership. The security rules directly enforce the relationship between the user ID in the path (`{userId}`) and the authenticated user's UID (`request.auth.uid`).
